# Welcome to the RobAir Open source project!
RobAir Manufacturing guide 
This guide is divided in several parts:
1.	Design (CAD): you will find the complete assembly of the RobAir Telepresence robot and each one of the parts with their corresponding files for download in different formats (.PRT ,.STEP, .IGES)
2.	Mechanical manufacturing: In this section is described all the manufacturing process of RobAir.

2.1.	Materials and tools: list of raw materials, equipment and tools that are necessary to build RobAir.
2.2.	Parts made by laser machine: here you will find the files .dfx ready to be use in the laser machine.
2.3.	Parts made in strato: find here the files . to build the parts made by this process 
2.4.	Assembling the robot: General description of the assembly process
2.5.	Electronical connections: General information about electronical configuration and connection procedure
